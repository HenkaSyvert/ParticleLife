	- fix delta in gpu
	- particle starting locations outside sphere?...
	- lint scripts
	- cooler graphics
	- GUI for attraction matrix
	- map particles to sound with fibonacci sphere
	- export to web assembly
	- add particle interaction across edge for wrap_universe
	- normalize dir vec 
	- add infinite attraction radius
	- inverse square attraction curve
	- hide variables in funcs (pba?)
	- re-send positions etc to gpu on restart
