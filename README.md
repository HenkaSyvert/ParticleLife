# ParticleLife
```
todo:
	- make 2d version
	- figure out optimal work group sizes for gpu and parallize i, j loop more
	- fix delta in gpu
	- particle starting locations outside sphere?...
	- lint scripts
	- cooler graphics
	- GUI for attraction matrix
	- map particles to sound with fibonacci sphere
	- export to web assembly
	- add particle interaction across edge for wrap_universe
	- normalize dir vec 
	- add infinite attraction radius
	- inverse square attraction curve
	- re-send positions etc to gpu on restart
	- interleaved data better for gpu?
	- when collide with universe edge, just remove velocity that points outside
	- reflect velocities when passing universe edge?
